You MUST scroll down repeatedly until you reach the very end of the response where action buttons appear. Keep scrolling down until you see a 'Copy' button or a copy icon (it may look like two overlapping squares). Once the Copy button is visible on screen, tap it.

Do these actions in this EXACT order: Step 1: Tap the message input field at the bottom of the chat (where it says 'Type a message' or 'Message'). Step 2: Use the 'paste' action — this will paste the clipboard content into the input field. Do NOT try to long-press or manually paste — just use the paste action directly. Step 3: After pasting, you should see text in the input field. Now tap the green Send button (arrow icon) to send the message. Mark done after the message is sent.",
